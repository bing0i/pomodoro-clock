# Pomodoro Clock
This is an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project).
Unfortunately, although this is a pairing project, I did this project by myself. 
Pomodoro clock is a famous method for concentration.
The project does exactly the same and of course, you can change the time.
